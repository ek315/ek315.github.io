I am a Robotics PhD candidate at MIT working in the <a href='https://darbelofflab.mit.edu/'>d’Arbeloff Robotics Lab</a> and am advised by <a href='https://meche.mit.edu/people/faculty/asada%40mit.edu'> Harry Asada</a>. My research interests include developing control and estimation algorithms for safe dynamic human-robot interaction, and implementing them on hardware. Previously, I received my M.S. in Mechanical Engineering from MIT in 2021. I obtained my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science from Georgia Tech in 2019, where I did undergraduate research primarily with <a href='https://ae.gatech.edu/directory/person/jonathan-rogers'>Jonathan Rogers</a>, and spent many an hour on the Formula SAE Team, <a href='https://www.gtms.gatech.edu/.'> GTMS</a>. I have held several industry internships and plan to work in industry after completing my PhD. 

<!-- In my free time I enjoy reading, long hikes, running, and board games. -->

<!-- I am very interested in working on robotics learning and control problems in the context of the medical or space industry. -->

<!-- I try to get heavily involved in my community and at MIT I have served as a mentor and treasurer of the Makerworkshop, Professional Development Officer of the Graduate Women in Robotics club, and President of the Mechanical Engineering Graduate Association of Women. Additionally, I enjoy managing projects and helping others make their project a success. I have gained experience in this through serving as a Teaching Assistant for MIT's 2.12 Intro to Robotics class for 2 semesters. -->

<!-- At Georgia Tech I worked with Prof. Jonathan Rogers as an undergraduate researcher on a robot for an arboretum that drove on a cable to monitor vegetation below, as well as a docking system for landing UAVs on moving ground vehicles. I also was on Georgia Tech’s Formula SAE team working on the controls and manufacturing sub-teams. I received the Astronaut Scholarship in 2018. -->
