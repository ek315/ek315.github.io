<h3>Project Description</h3>
<p> Plants in arboretums must often be monitored to assess growth, check for disease, and other measures. I designed a waterproof, battery powered cable driven robot that stops at regular intervals to allow data capture of the undergrowth below. To keep the platform level with the addition of other sensors on the underside, the center of mass may be adjusted with the use of two knobs that can adjust the position of two weights. The robot attaches to the cable with spring loaded sheave wheels, and a motor drives the robot along the cable via another sheave wheel. In addition to the autonomous procedure, the robot may be reprogrammed wirelessly.</p>
