<p> I am very interested in working on robotics learning and control problems in the context of the medical or space industry.</p>
<!-- to create solutions to challenges -->

<p>I try to get heavily involved in my community and at MIT I have served as a mentor and treasurer of the Makerworkshop, Professional Development Officer of the Graduate Women in Robotics club, and President of the Mechanical Engineering Graduate Association of Women. Additionally, I enjoy managing projects and helping others make their project a success. I have gained experience in this through serving as a Teaching Assistant for MIT's 2.12 Intro to Robotics class for 2 semesters.</p>


<p> At Georgia Tech I worked with Prof. Jonathan Rogers as an undergraduate researcher on a robot for an arboretum that drove on a cable to monitor vegetation below, as well as a docking system for landing UAVs on moving ground vehicles. I also was on Georgia Techâ€™s Formula SAE team working on the controls and manufacturing sub-teams. I received the Astronaut Scholarship in 2018.</p>

<p> In my free time I enjoy backpacking, training for half marathons, skiing, reading, and playing strategy board games. </p>

<p> Please send me an email if you want to learn more about my projects or discuss an idea!</p>
