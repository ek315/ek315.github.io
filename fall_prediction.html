<h3>Project Description</h3>



<p>This project includes advancements in predicting falls using data driven methods and exploring novel physical injury prevention mechanisms. Data is gathered from human subjects experiencing various loss-of-balance scenarios while utilizing a walker. A predictive model based on multiple Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks is formulated using three innovative approaches. Initially, distinct fall types are identified from limited data by learning rapid and gradual falls separately. Next, a "Timer LSTM" is developed to estimate the remaining time before an imbalance becomes irrecoverable and requires activating the fall prevention mechanism. Subsequently, if time permits, additional data is collected and further evaluated for the potential of a fall. This methodology reduced the false positive rate in fall prediction. Additionally, complex cases are analyzed using a metric of data insufficiency termed the Lipschitz quotient. Features that reduce the Lipschitz quotients, thus enhancing data predictability, are identified and included with the original input signals. </p>


<!-- <ol>
  <li>Collected fall data with the use of a mobility aid.

  <li>Introduce a technique to identify diverse fall types with limited data - by separately learning characteristics of fast and slow falls.

  <li>Present a technique for predicting the time remaining until a fall, so that the false positive rate can be reduced by observing more data and making more cautious predictions until the deadline of the fall/no-fall decision.

  <li>Analyze a given dataset using the Lipschitz quotient, and augment the data by incorporating additional signals to remedy the error-prone, confounding fall cases.

  <li>Design and build a new fall prevention system through integration of an injury prevention mechanism into a mobility aid.

<!-- <p>Falls among older adults can result in severe injuries, significantly reducing their quality of life. There's a notable absence of devices designed for preventing fall injuries, particularly for those with balance impairments who depend on mobility aids. This project aims to enhance the capabilities of a walker by enabling real-time fall prediction and implementing a swiftly adaptable mechanism to prevent injuries. The primary hurdle lies in accurately predicting falls in real-time—a crucial process that requires timely decision-making. Anticipating a fall in advance is essential to allow the system enough time to activate the injury prevention mechanism.</p> -->



<h3>Outcome</h3>

<p>Using these additional features further enhanced performance, with the most effective model achieving a 97% success rate in identifying falls at a 0.17% false positive rate. The predictive approach is implemented within an innovative walker-type fall prediction and prevention prototype. This walker has high maneuverability due to its compact footprint and becomes untippable by deploying its expandable legs when a fall is predicted.</p>
